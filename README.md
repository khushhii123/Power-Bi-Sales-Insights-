## Problem Statement

With multiple locations across India, AtliQ Hardware is a business that supplies its customers with computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers. The company's sales director is having a lot of trouble understanding how the business is doing and what troubles it is currently facing because sales are not meeting expectations and are rapidly falling. Additionally, as a result of human nature, the regional managers are uncomfortable consuming data from Excel files whenever he calls them to inquire about the present state of the market and sales. This is a clear source of frustration.
